# html-tools
SIMPLE STARTER REPO: intended primarily for beginner developers and students
DESC: Repo for general tools / scripts related to vanilla javascript, html and css only

ABOUT: This repo will be a dumping ground for practise scripts and animation tools for the most part. Database and API scripts will be stored in a different repo. These are intended to serve as practise using github itself, too. Keep this in mind when reviewing issues/comments etc on github since many will be dummy actions as I get familiar with the command line and jargon.

Scripts will be heavily commented for ease of reuse and customization. I don't ask for any acknowledgement or mentions for using scripts released in this repo, but if you like something or use something I'm sharing, it would be nice for a shout out to show some support. If you have any suggestions for me, then please reach out and make some noise. It not only helps my visibility on github but I'm sure I'll have plenty to learn from the community.

FUTURE REPOS: Be on the lookout for new repos, this is only the first. I'll be releasing python notebook scripts for stock/forex analytics as I practise manipulating matplotlib charts, LayTeX, Pandas, and working with larger datasets from the public domain. I'll probably have some React projects to post in 2022, as well. Hopefully I'll be starting to share some machine learning models as I stumble across novel methods as my studies/research project progresses. I'll be employing Tensorflow in both javascript and python, mostly relating to financial markets, image processing and Blender 3D modelling.
