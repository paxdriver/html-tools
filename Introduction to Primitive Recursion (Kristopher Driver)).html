            // first things first, some definitions...
            // If you're having trouble with the horizontal scrolling to read these comments, check your text editor for a setting that sounds like "wrap lines" or "wrap comments" to keep all the text on your screen in front of you. Just in case anyone thought they had to scroll left and right just to read all of this nonsense it would drive them batty. On with the gong, as they say:
            
            // DEFINITIONS-y stuff:
            // <---- slash, slash means the computer will ignore anything written in this line. These are called 'comments'
            // We use this double slash to help us make notes describing our code or leaving reminders for ourselves later on
            
            /* For longer comments that span many lines you may want to use star-slash, with the stars facing inside of the slashes
            for multi-line comments (no need to keep writing "//" at the beginning of every line) */
            
            // To define a variable it's best to use a keyword "let", as in "let myvariable equal 0 ---> let myvariable = 0"
            // We can still create variables without using the "let", "const", "var" keywords, but they will considered part of the "global scope" or "lexical environment", a concept known as "clojure". We won't go into that much detail in this lesson but in case you're curious, that's what you should look up if you want to find out more.
            
            // DATA TYPES => String, Number, Array, Object, function  (basically)
                // String:
            string_variable = "This is a string, even numbers are considered letters in here, (aka 'characters')"   // use single or double quotes, but not either or. It must be one or the other you decide to use to wrap text. Keep in mind apostrophes and quotations because that's a very common source of debug errors and malicious code.
            another_string_variable = 'Single quotes also work, if you need to use "double quotes" as part of the string '        
                // Number aka Integer (or floating points, or doubles.. whatever. Just basically)
            int_number = 5     // integers are just numbers without decimal points. They cal also be negative numbers
                // Array aka List
            list_array = ['this is a list of variables or values', 'of almost anything', 'you can imagine', string_variable, another_string_variable, int_number]
            console.log(list_array)
            // arrays are also called lists, they are a single variable name that stores several pieces of info. We can retrieve their values by using the order in which they've been assigned. The index starts at 0, instead of one.
            // Array example: x[0] = "first index"; x[1] = 'second index'
            // Think of a variable as any single item you want to carry around or reference to others. Think of an array like a group of data, like coordinates are x, y, z it would be easiest to store all 3 in a "position" variable.
            
            // OBJECT -> you can ignore that one for now. Technically everything in javascript is an "Object" as defined by the language, even functions and operators. It would be a 300 page philosophical treatise to try to describe javascript objects in a single tutorial script. But here I go again, trying anyway lol.
            
            // So long as we remember the order in which the coordinates are assigned, we can always check vertical position by calling position[1], or the x coordinate by call position[0], for example.
            
            // Be careful not to use keywords reserved by the programming language, words like "function", "Number", "Array", "arguments"
            
            // Parentheses are used to group values together and work just like order of operations in math: (1 + 3) * 5
            // use double equals '==' to check if something is equal to another. Single "=" means "assign the thing on the right to the variable name on the left"
