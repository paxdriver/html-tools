            // It's an array of numbers but also contains an object.
            // Well, if we apply sort() to our deep_names[10] array variable it shouldn't affect the order of the shallow_names or simple_copy_names
        
        // console.log(deep_names[10].sort())   // With this line active only this one instance is affected, because it is not a reference to anything else, we created it from scratch using our recursive function

        // NOTICE: now deep_names[10], the array inside of our array, is now sorted but only for deep_names since it was copied from the original using our customArrayCopy() function

        console.log(simple_copy_names[8].sort()) // With this one, even shallow_names has changed its sort!!!

        // ONE SOLUTION: Recursive Functions Baby!
        // Create a function that will copy an array AND disassociate all referenced elements from its original
        // this way, the copy that we make doesn't alter the original or vice versa, because javascript can be stupid sometimes lol
        function customArrayCopy(arr){
            // make sure the object we're copying is the right type so we don't get errors when our function comes across an element that we're not trying to copy (a nested object or array, the 'deep' part as opposed to the 'shallow' copy, which the spread operator does nicely for us)
            if (typeof arr !== 'object') {
                // if the current value is not a value of type 'Array' or 'Object', then it has no 'depth' (ie: it is not a container storing multiple values, unlike objects/arrays), so we can just return it as is and exit the function call right away. No need to do anything more.
                return arr  
            }
            
            // Are we looking at an array?
            let outputObject = Array.isArray(arr)  // will return true if it's an array, and false if it's an object, because of the if (typeof) test above there can be no other type
		    let tmp_result
		    // if yes, set our temporary variable to be an empty array
		    if (outputObject) { tmp_result = [] }
		    // if the object we're looking at is not an array, then it must be an object since we're running this code from inside an if(typeof )
		    else { tmp_result = {} }

                // equivalently, we could use an inline if statement like this... variable = (true/false) ? assign_this_value_if_true : assign_this_if_false
            let result = (outputObject) ? [] : {} // either make this variable an empty array if the function's input is an array type, or object if it's an object type
            // remember, any other type (string, number, etc.) will have already kicked out of the function by the return statement above.

            let current_value               // we're going to use this to call this function again on every value in an array or object
            for (key in arr) {
                current_value = arr[key]    // whatever the current value is, number, string, array, object, boolean; use that to run this function again before assigning to our result variable. We do this to make sure that all nested objects keep getting shallow-ly copied rather than getting lost in shallow copy's soup as when using [...spread]
                // recursively calling this same function to perform the data type check again to the nested elements, and their nested elements, etc, etc
                result[key] = customArrayCopy(current_value) // assigning a key/index the corresponding value from the original array/object
                // this is like saying "step through every element and run this function. this function returns the input unchanged unless it is an array or an object..."
                // "... if the value turns out to be an array or an object, loop through each key/index and run this function on each of those values - recursively"
            }
            // we're going to use this function to assign a value, so we need to return the final result
            return result
        }

        // REAL WORLD SOLUTION: just use this --> my_copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original_Object))
        // WHOA! way too much hassle and complexity for a simple thing like copying an array! There must be a better way!
        // Well, you're in luck, there is. The standard practise is to call a built-in few functions instead to accomplish all of this on a single line

        let arr_b = ['text-0', 'text-1', 'text-2', 'text-3']
        console.log(arr_a)      // log the entire array so we can see what's stored inside of it
        console.log(arr_a[3])   // get the value of just index 3 (remember, indexes start from zero, so '3' is the fourth index)
        console.log(arr_a['1'])   
        
        // Note: indexes are Number types, even though javascript will work with a text string we can't do math on text strings

        console.log(arr_b[1+1])
        console.log(arr_b[(1*4)-2])
        // But this WON'T work...
        console.log(arr_b['2' + 1])
        // ... well, technically it will if we had 22 indexes. You see, '2' + 1 converts to a string of text, and 2 + 1 in text is the text '21', not the math of adding 1 to the number 2
        for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
            arr_b.push( i + ' was added by looping')
        }
        console.log(arr_b['2' + 1])
        // console.log(arr_b)
        
        
        // Methods are functions which are built in to the data type, since there are some actions typical and capable to all variables of the same data type
        // Built-in methods of arrays, for example, can iterate or loop through all items in the array. Since arrays are defined as storing 1 or more values, identified by their order / index, all arrays share the functionality of built-in functions that helps us use them.
        // the most useful array methods for playing around with code if you're just starting out: push(), pop(), sort(), forEach(), filter(), map()
        
        // Objects are like arrays, but instead of being in order and having a unique index to identify each value, we can set a 'key' to be whatever reference we'd like to use. 
        // One could make an Object that looks like an array by making Object keys index numbers, but that would defeat the purpose of being able to name the key/index, and we'd not be able to use the built-in array methods on our object so it wouldn't be very helpful... but we could do it if we want to!
        // We can also define methods for ourselves to manipulate objects that we create

        let ingredients = ['apples', 'onions', 'chicken']
        let instructions = ['preheat the pan', 'apply oil', 'mix ingredients in the pan', 'remove from heat after 10 minutes']
        let bakedChickenRecipe = { 'food': ingredients, 'guide': instructions }
        console.log(bakedChickenRecipe)
        
        // Array Methods
        let sortedIngredients = bakedChickenRecipe['food'].sort()
        console.log(sortedIngredients)  // sorts the array of ingredients so that chicken comes second
        console.log([4,3,2,1].sort())   // sorts an array by numbers in the same way, even if the array is not defined with a name the square brackets means it's still an array data type
        console.log(bakedChickenRecipe['food']) // the sort method actually changes the array of the original, it doesn't just give us the response
        
        // not all methods actually change the array that called it, let's look at some more useful methods on arrays...
        let preheat = bakedChickenRecipe['guide'].filter( x => { if (x.includes('preheat')) return true } )
        console.log(preheat)
        // filter() takes in a function as a parameter (in other words it requires a single function as its 'arguments'). This can be predefined and called by name or simply written anonymously inside of the filter method's parentheses
        // filter will iterate through all items in the array and check if the function returns true or false. If true, then that item is added to the output.
        // see how if our function returns true no matter what then none of the list's items get filtered out

        console.log(alwaysfalse)
        // NOTE: filter() method will create a new array and not alter or change the original array, unlike sort() did
        
        // In the example above, preheat was defined to be the output of the filter() method on the 'instructions' array inside of the 'bakedChickenRecipe' object.
        // To our true/false check used another array method called "includes()" to check if the current item contained the word 'preheat' in its value
        // The includes() method does not alter the original array either
        
        let substring = preheat.includes('heat')    //  checks if the word 'heat' is contained inside the array value, which in this case preheat[0] is 'preheat', so the substring 'heat' is in there and the method returns true.
        console.log(substring)    // The reason this output is 'true' and not the instruction 'preheat the pan' is because includes() returns true or false, and filter requires a true or false to know whether to include or exclude each item in the array that called the filter() method.
        
        // So methods are functions that apply themselves to the array that called them using dot notation
        // Arrays are ordered lists, Objects are unordered lists with custom keys rather than numbered indexes
        // Objects can contain other objects as values, and Arrays can contain other arrays as values
        // Objects can contain other arrays, and Arrays can contain other Objects
